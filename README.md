**_Eau Claire Hair Salon_**

A C# MVC application for a hair salon.8/9/19. *By Maryana Antonyuk*

**Description**

MVC web application to help a hair salon owner manage h employees (stylists) and their clients. An owner should be able to add a list of stylists working at the salon, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists have specific specialties, so each client can only see (belong to) a single stylist.
